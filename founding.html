                <p>My name is Hayden Chen. I was born with profound hearing loss in both ears caused by a mutation in the GJB2 gene. My parents didn’t suspect a thing until I was around four months old because of how I had passed the newborn hearing screenings. So when they did come to realize, it was as if their world had suddenly ended.</p>

                <p>Their grief hadn’t subsided, but my parents began searching for ways. They brought me to Taiwan in hopes of having a better hearing test result and perhaps get some advice. This didn’t work out, but the hospital staff was very encouraging and tried their best to console my parents. When we got back to the US, Rady Children’s Hospital told us about the then-novel cochlear implantation option that we eventually decided on, and that decision has shaped my entire life.</p>

                <p>I’ve heard the story many times, so I decided to do something about it. In the summer of 2023, my dad (a professional violist) enlisted the help of his friends in Taiwan to host a benefit concert for the hearing foundation in Taipei that had helped our family at our lowest point after learning of my hearing loss. That concert, in which I played cello, included solo/chamber instrumental music, and it attracted lots of support and donations for the hearing foundation. I thought, why not do something similar back in the US for Rady Children’s? After all, they were the ones who had saved us all from falling into an inescapable void back when I was a few months old.</p>

<p>In times like these, anyone would need encouragement and expertise they could easily rely on. Besides getting us back on track, Rady’s had showered us with their support both before and after my implantation surgery. They also played a big part in my learning to listen with my new devices and talk.
    It was time to give back to the people who had helped me so much earlier on. In September 2023, I got together with some of my friends at school, and together we started Fortissimo Challenge. All of us had musical backgrounds and could play instruments reasonably well, and we together agreed to practice solos and chamber music in ensembles and perform concerts for various audiences to not simply raise money for Rady’s but also give back to the community as whole. </p>            </div>

<p>At first, we struggled to kickstart the practice sessions for lack of motivation, but this was instantly fixed when we set down a hard date for our first concert and started actually focusing. Larger practices have been at my house this past year, and while one group would be practicing, other club members would be chatting and joking quietly on the side while munching on pizza. These practice sessions have brought us all closer together, and our bonds have become stronger and stronger.

                <p>From Fortissimo Challenge's beginning days, we have gradually expanded our outreach efforts to include performing in cultural festivals and hosting instrument expositions for younger students, hoping to provide a spark for their potentially lifelong musical journey. We hope that our passion for music can carry at a fortissimo dynamic to all those around us and that they would feel the profound joy of living in a world with music. </p>
